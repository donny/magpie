# magpie

Magpie is an idea board iOS app for sprint retrospective meetings implemented using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). It is the iOS counterpart of [Kestrel](https://github.com/donny/kestrel).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Firebase iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup), [Eureka](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka), and [APESuperHUD](https://github.com/apegroup/APESuperHUD).

### Project

Magpie is the iOS app version of [Kestrel](https://github.com/donny/kestrel) using [Firebase iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). The iOS app talks to the same database as used by Kestrel. It utilises the Firebase Realtime Database that synchronises in realtime to every connected client (using WebSocket). After logging in, a user can view the lists and cards for the sprint retrospective meeting. The screenshots of the iOS app can be seen below:

# magpie

Magpie is an idea board iOS app for sprint retrospective meetings implemented using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). It is the iOS counterpart of [Kestrel](https://github.com/donny/kestrel).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Firebase iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup), [Eureka](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka), and [APESuperHUD](https://github.com/apegroup/APESuperHUD).

### Project

Magpie utilises the Firebase Realtime Database that synchronises in realtime to every connected client (using WebSocket). This allows changes made by one user (e.g. new card creation, card voting, etc) to be propagated to other connected Magpie users.
